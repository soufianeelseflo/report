            <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>Acumenis provides an AI-powered insight engine that performs market analysis, competitor intelligence,
                and related research based on user-defined queries and parameters. The Service autonomously gathers,
                synthesizes, and analyzes data from various sources to generate reports ("Reports") intended to provide
                strategic insights. The specific scope, depth, and turnaround time depend on the service tier selected
                (<a href="/pricing">see Pricing</a>).</p>
            <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We are constantly evolving the Service,
                and its form and nature may change without prior notice to you.</p>

            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>To access certain features, you may need to register for an account. You agree to provide accurate,
                current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information updated. You are
                responsible for safeguarding your password and for all activities that occur under your account. You
                agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

            <h2>4. Use Restrictions</h2>

                </li>
                <li>To engage in any conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Service, or
                    which, as determined by us, may harm Acumenis or users of the Service or expose them to liability.
                </li>
                <li>To attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage, or disrupt any parts of the

                losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to
                your violation of these Terms or your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, your User

                for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Upon termination,
                your right to use the Service will immediately cease. Provisions of these Terms that by their nature
                should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
                provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

            <h2>11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

                binding arbitration in [Your City, Your State - e.g., Wilmington, Delaware], using the English language
                in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by one commercial
                arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract
                disputes. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the
                right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent
                jurisdiction.</p>

            <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision
                is material, we will provide reasonable notice prior to any new terms taking effect, such as by posting
                on our website or sending an email. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole
                discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree
                to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

            <h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Acumenis regarding the Service and supersede
                all prior agreements. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that
                provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions
                will remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term shall be deemed a further or continuing
                waiver of such term or any other term. Our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms
                shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
