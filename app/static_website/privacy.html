        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 1, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Nexus Plan ("Nexus Plan," "we," "us," or "our"). We provide an autonomous AI engine for deep market
            analysis and competitor intelligence (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
            disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website (the "Site") and use our Service. Please
            read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not
            access the site or use the service.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you
            about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to
            periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Site and
            Service includes:</p>

        <h3>A. Personal Data You Provide</h3>
        <p>When you initiate an analysis or contact us, you may voluntarily provide us with certain personally
            identifiable information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Your name and email address when you contact support or
                potentially during the order process.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis Objectives:</strong> The specific details, parameters, company names, market segments,
                competitors, and questions you provide for the AI to analyze ("Query Data"). While this may contain
                business information, we treat it with the utmost confidentiality as outlined below.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Payment Data</h3>
        <p>All financial transactions are processed through our third-party payment processor, Lemon Squeezy. When you
            make a purchase, you provide your payment information directly to Lemon Squeezy. We do not collect or store
            your full credit card number or other sensitive payment details. We may receive transaction confirmation
            data from Lemon Squeezy (such as purchase amount and date) but not your full financial details.</p>

        <h3>C. Derivative Data (Website Usage)</h3>
        <p>Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Site, such as your IP address, browser
            type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the
            Site. We may use standard analytics tools (like Plausible Analytics or a self-hosted equivalent,
            prioritizing privacy) to gather this aggregated, anonymized data to improve website performance and user
            experience. We do not typically use cookies that track personal information across sites.</p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience.
            Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the Site or Service to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fulfill your analysis request and generate the intelligence report.</li>
            <li>Process payments and manage your order.</li>
            <li>Respond to your customer service requests and support needs via email (<a
                    href="mailto:support@Nexus Plan.ai">support@Nexus Plan.ai</a>).</li>
            <li>Monitor and analyze usage and trends to improve the Site and Service functionality.</li>
            <li>Maintain the security and integrity of our systems.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Crucially, your specific Query Data is used *solely* for the purpose of generating the requested
                analysis report for you. It is not used to train general AI models beyond the ephemeral context of your
                request, nor is it shared or sold to third parties.</strong></p>

        <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information or confidential
            Query Data to outside parties except as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We utilize secure, third-party services for essential functions:
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Payment Processing:</em> Lemon Squeezy handles payments securely. Their privacy policy
                        governs their data use.</li>
                    <li><em>AI Model APIs:</em> We access large language models (e.g., via OpenRouter) through secure
                        APIs. These providers process your Query Data ephemerally to generate the synthesis but are
                        contractually obligated (and technically designed) not to retain or use this specific data for
                        their own model training post-request.</li>
                    <li><em>Infrastructure:</em> Cloud hosting providers (e.g., AWS, Vercel) host our Site and backend
                        systems under strict security protocols. They do not have access to the content of your Query
                        Data or reports.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in
                response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency), but only to the
                extent legally mandated and after careful review.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your
                information might be transferred as part of the business assets, subject to the commitments made in this
                Privacy Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement robust administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect your
            information. Your Query Data and generated reports are processed in isolated environments and stored
            encrypted at rest. Access is strictly limited on a need-to-know basis. While we have taken reasonable steps
            to secure the information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures
            are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against interception or
            misuse.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your Query Data and the generated report only as long as necessary to fulfill the analysis request
            and provide customer support related to that specific order, typically for a limited period (e.g., 30-90
            days) unless required otherwise by law. Contact information provided via support emails may be retained
            longer as part of standard business communication records. Aggregated, anonymized website analytics data may
            be kept longer for trend analysis.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR/CCPA Considerations)</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These may
            include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> Requesting copies of the personal information we hold about you
                (primarily contact information).</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> Requesting correction of inaccurate contact information.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):</strong> Requesting deletion of your contact
                information and any associated Query Data/reports, subject to legal retention requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> Requesting limitations on how we use your contact
                information.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> Objecting to certain processing activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@Nexus Plan.ai">support@Nexus Plan.ai</a>.
            We will respond to verifiable requests within the timeframes mandated by applicable law.</p>
        <p>Note: Due to the autonomous and ephemeral nature of the AI analysis process using third-party models,
            retrieving or modifying Query Data *after* an analysis has begun or completed may be technically infeasible.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>We primarily use essential session information necessary for the basic functioning of the Site and order
            process. We aim to minimize the use of persistent tracking cookies. Any analytics tools used are configured
            to respect user privacy and anonymize data where possible (e.g., IP anonymization). You can typically manage
            cookie preferences through your browser settings.</p>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal
            information from children under 18. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal
            information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

        <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located
            outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws
            may differ. We utilize service providers (like cloud hosting and AI APIs) that may operate globally, but we
            select providers committed to high standards of data protection and security, often relying on mechanisms
            like Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers where applicable.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
            "Last Updated" date and will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this
            policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>

        <h2>12. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>

                be reviewed by qualified legal counsel to ensure full compliance with all applicable laws and
                regulations specific to your operations and jurisdiction.</em></p>
