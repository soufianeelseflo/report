        **You are about to open an issue and interrupt the day of a stranger on the internet. And that's okay!**

        We all need help, and we should try to help each other as much as possible. But before you submit your issue, please make sure you've:
        1. Read through the README.
        2. Searched through existing GitHub issues to see if one of them answered your question.
        3. Copied and pasted the README into ChatGPT or your favorite LLM of choice and asked it the question.
        4. Spent 5 minutes thinking through this on your own.

        If all these failed, please feel free to open an issue. :)
